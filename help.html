            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p><span class="text-color-blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by
                a
                group of
                dedicated students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                <br>
                <br>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="text-color-blue">Join</span> leverages
                the principles of
                kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is important to note that <span class="text-color-blue">Join</span> is designed as an educational

                intended for
                extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot

            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="text-color-blue">Join</span></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <div>Exploring the Board</div>

                    <p>When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
                        represents
                        your project and
                        contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Creating Contacts</div>

                    <p>In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
                        to the
                        "Contacts" section,
                        click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can
                        be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Adding Cards</div>

                    <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
                        represent individual
                        tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                        task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Moving Cards</div>

                    <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board
                        by dragging
                        and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div>Deleting Cards</div>

                    <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete
                        it. Deleting a
                        card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards,
                        as
                        this action is irreversible.
                        Remember that using <span class="text-color-blue">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
                        updates from you and
                        your team to
                        ensure the board reflects the current state of your project. Have more questions about
